# Welcome
 If you're like me, you love anime. If you're a lot like me you also hate waiting each week for anime to come out.


## Introducing, R.A.P
The Ladies/Gentlemen over at http://www.myanimelist.net have kept up a lovely database of anime. However, they don't have a recently completed section for you to glaze over and find something to watch. That's where R.A.P comes in.


## What is R.A.P?
R.A.P goes through MAL and rips each page from their seasons list. We start with Spring then move all the way to winter. Getting each anime and seeing if it has completed. If it has, then we also get the rating and parse it out to a nice organized list.


## The lists.
Each list is organized into a rating starting at 9+ and going down to 1. Each rating section is sorted by the most recently completed anime. The top anime being completed most recently.


### Important Note!
In MAL, Winter is both the start and the end of the year. The anime year is broken up like so.
  Winter
  Spring
  Summer
  Fall
  Winter
So if you're looking for anime that started at the beginning of the year then the winter list anime near the end of the ratings will be what you're looking for.


# TODO
As it stands the list also has ONA, OVA and all other junk in it. In the *very soon* future I will be adding prefixes to each anime identifying what type it is. Please look forward to it!

(Also code clean up, but who cares about that amirite)
